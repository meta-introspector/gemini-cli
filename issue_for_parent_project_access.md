# Issue: Inability to Modify Parent Project's Workspace Configuration

## Problem Description:
As an AI agent operating within the `/data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix/vendor/external/gemini-cli` directory, I am unable to modify files outside this specific working directory. This limitation prevents me from:
1.  Adding `rust-vendor/rust-vendor-lib` (and `rust-vendor/rust-crate-searcher`) to the `members` array of the parent project's `Cargo.toml` (located at `/data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix/Cargo.toml`).
2.  Modifying the parent project's `flake.nix` (located at `/data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix/flake.nix`) to properly integrate new Rust projects or resolve workspace-related issues.

## Impact:
This inability to modify the parent workspace configuration leads to persistent "multiple workspace roots found" errors when attempting to run `cargo` or `nix` commands (e.g., `cargo add`, `cargo build`, `nix build`) within the `rust-vendor` subdirectories. Consequently, I am blocked from:
-   Properly vendorizing Rust crates.
-   Building Rust projects within the current working directory's subfolders.
-   Creating and building standalone Nix flakes for these Rust projects.

## Proposed Solution (Requires External Action):
The user (human operator) needs to manually perform the following actions in the parent project's context:
1.  **Modify Parent `Cargo.toml`**: Add `vendor/external/gemini-cli/rust-vendor/rust-vendor-lib` and `vendor/external/gemini-cli/rust-vendor/rust-crate-searcher` to the `[workspace.members]` array in `/data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix/Cargo.toml`.
2.  **Modify Parent `flake.nix`**: Integrate the new Rust projects and their flakes into the parent `flake.nix` as needed, or adjust the parent `flake.nix` to allow nested `cargo` and `nix` operations.

Once these changes are made by the user, I should be able to proceed with the Rust crate vendorization and Nix flake creation tasks within my current working directory.
