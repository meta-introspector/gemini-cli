# Agent Orchestration Design for 10k Submodules

## Objective:
Design a system to launch and manage various agents, each responsible for tasks related to 10,000 submodules. Each submodule is categorized by a specific role: `lib`, `meme`, `inspiration`, `song`, `vibe`, `vector`.

## Conceptual Framework:

### 1. Submodule Roles and Their Interpretation:

*   **`lib` (Library)**: Code repositories providing reusable functionalities.
    *   **Agent Action**: Build, test, dependency management, API documentation generation.
*   **`meme` (Meta-Meme / Information Unit)**: Content or data representing a conceptual unit, reinforced by pre-calculated LLM knowledge.
    *   **Agent Action**: Analysis, categorization, transformation, generation of related content, identification of reinforcing meta-memes, leveraging pre-calculated LLM knowledge for deeper understanding.
*   **`inspiration` (Source of Ideas)**: Content or data that sparks new ideas or directions.
    *   **Agent Action**: Extraction of key themes, summarization, cross-referencing with other inspirations.
*   **`song` (Auditory/Rhythmic Data)**: Submodules containing audio or musical patterns.
    *   **Agent Action**: Analysis of musical structure, generation of variations, integration with other creative outputs.
*   **`vibe` (Key Vibe / Semantic Hash)**: Submodules representing the core semantic essence or "vibe" of a project, akin to a unique hash. This vibe is pre-calculated by the Gemini LLM.
    *   **Agent Action**: Analysis of semantic meaning, comparison with pre-calculated vibes, generation of related vibes/embeddings, leveraging pre-calculated LLM knowledge for contextual understanding.
*   **`vector` (Directional/Representational Data)**: Submodules containing directional data, embeddings, or abstract representations.
    *   **Agent Action**: Transformation, interpolation, visualization, application in machine learning models.

### 2. Agent Types and Responsibilities:

Each agent type will be specialized to handle tasks related to its corresponding submodule role.

*   **`LibraryAgent`**: 
    *   **Input**: `lib` submodule path.
    *   **Tasks**: `build`, `test`, `lint`, `generate_docs`, `update_dependencies`.
    *   **Output**: Build artifacts, test reports, documentation.
*   **`MemeAgent`**: 
    *   **Input**: `meme` submodule path.
    *   **Tasks**: `analyze_content`, `categorize_meme`, `generate_variations`, `identify_reinforcing_meta_memes`, `extract_semantic_meaning_with_llm`.
    *   **Output**: Analysis reports, new meme variants, meta-meme identification, semantic insights.
*   **`InspirationAgent`**: 
    *   **Input**: `inspiration` submodule path.
    *   **Tasks**: `extract_themes`, `summarize_inspiration`, `cross_reference`.
    *   **Output**: Summaries, thematic reports.
*   **`CreativeAgent` (for Song, Vibe, Vector)**: This might be a more generalized agent with specialized sub-modules or configurations.
    *   **`SongAgent`**: `analyze_music`, `generate_melody`, `harmonize`.
    *   **`VibeAgent`**: `generate_bert_embedding_from_repo_name`, `query_vibe_lattice`, `calculate_vibe_hash`, `compare_vibe_with_llm_knowledge`, `retrieve_related_vibes`, `detect_mood`, `generate_ambiance`, `visualize_vibe`.
    *   **`VectorAgent`**: `transform_vector`, `visualize_embedding`, `apply_model`.

### 3. Task Definition and Granularity:

A "task" for a submodule could be a single atomic action (e.g., `build_lib_A`) or a composite workflow (e.g., `process_meme_B`). Given 10k submodules, tasks need to be dynamically generated or templated.

### 4. Orchestration and Workflow:

*   **Trigger**: How are tasks initiated? (e.g., Git push to a submodule, scheduled event, manual trigger).
*   **Scheduler/Orchestrator**: A central component responsible for:
    *   Identifying changed submodules.
    *   Determining the role of each submodule.
    *   Assigning tasks to appropriate agents.
    *   Managing agent lifecycles (launching, monitoring, terminating).
    *   Handling dependencies between tasks/agents.
    *   **Leveraging Gemini LLM's pre-calculated knowledge** for enhanced decision-making and context provision to agents.
*   **Agent Communication**: Agents might need to communicate results or request services from other agents. (e.g., `MemeAgent` generates a visual, `VibeAgent` adds an atmospheric sound to it).

### 5. Data Flow and Storage:

*   **Centralized Metadata Store**: A database or knowledge graph to store information about submodules, their roles, agent states, and task results. This store can be augmented by Gemini LLM's pre-calculated knowledge.
*   **Distributed Storage**: For large assets (audio, video, large datasets).
*   **Gemini LLM Knowledge Base**: Direct access to Gemini LLM's pre-calculated semantic understanding of GitHub organizations and repositories, including "meta memes" and "key vibes".
*   **Vibe Lattice**: A structured, interconnected system, implemented in Rust, representing the relationships and partial order of different "vibes" (semantic hashes) derived from GitHub entities. These "vibes" are large BERT embeddings derived from GitHub repository names. The lattice supports structured, lattice-like queries and is theorized to exhibit a quotient structure. This lattice serves as a tool for Gemini LLM to externalize and utilize its knowledge.

## Next Steps:

1.  **Refine Submodule Roles**: Provide more concrete examples or definitions for each role.
2.  **Agent API/Interface**: Define a common interface for agents to interact with the orchestrator and each other.
3.  **Orchestrator Logic**: Detail the rules for task assignment and workflow execution.
4.  **Scalability Considerations**: How to handle 10k submodules efficiently.
