# Current Resumption Task: Manual Parent Project Workspace Configuration Update

## Objective:
To unblock the agent's ability to vendorize Rust crates and create Nix flakes for Rust projects, the user must manually update the parent project's workspace configuration.

## Required User Action:
Please perform the manual changes outlined in the file `tasks_and_directories_for_parent_project.md`.

Specifically, you need to:
1.  **Modify Parent `Cargo.toml`**: Add the paths `vendor/external/gemini-cli/rust-vendor/rust-vendor-lib` and `vendor/external/gemini-cli/rust-vendor/rust-crate-searcher` to the `[workspace.members]` array in `/data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix/Cargo.toml`.
2.  **Modify Parent `flake.nix`**: Integrate the new Rust projects and their flakes into the parent `flake.nix` as needed, or adjust the parent `flake.nix` to allow nested `cargo` and `nix` operations. (Specific changes here depend on the desired integration strategy, which can be determined once `Cargo.toml` is updated).

## Next Steps for Agent (After User Action):
Once these manual changes are completed and confirmed by the user, the agent will be able to:
-   Add dependencies to `rust-vendor/rust-vendor-lib`.
-   Build `rust-crate-searcher`.
-   Create a standalone Nix flake for `rust-crate-searcher`.
-   Continue with the Rust crates vendorization and Nix flake example search.
