# New Task: Search for Rust Crates Using Multiple Search Engines

## Objective:
-   Find relevant Rust crates using various search engines.

## Current Status & Limitations:
-   Currently, only `google_web_search` is available as a search tool.

## Next Steps (Awaiting User Guidance):
-   Please specify if there are other search engines you would like me to simulate using `google_web_search` (e.g., by searching for "crates.io <query>", "github rust <query>").
-   Alternatively, if you have specific queries in mind for `google_web_search`, please provide them.
